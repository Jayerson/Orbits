    <!-- Step 2: draw each section at relative rotational speed and focus -->
    <!-- Step 3: draw a 2nd ellipse at relative speed -->
    <!-- Step 4: draw a single curve path (Hohmann transfer) that meets target from origin-orbit -->
    <!-- Step 5: draw a straight line/two curve path (impulse transfer) and use approximation to walk the shot -->
    <!--    5A: electric ion pulse -->
    <!--    5B: fusion rocket, 1 gee -->
    <!-- Step 6 : Local gravity and Lagrange points -->
    <!--    6A: Interplanetary highway -->
    <!-- Step 7 : refactor with N-R -->
    <!-- Step 8: repeat 4, 5, and 6 for a near-Earth asteroid -->

<!-- delay issue options:
    
    - push on with delay() function

    - draw as much angle as the orbit should cover in that period (use smallish units)
